Learning objectives
This course is an intensive introduction to the most widely-used machine learning methods. The first goal is to provide a basic intuitive understanding of these techniques: what they are good for, how they work, how they relate to one another, and their strengths and weaknesses. The second goal is to provide a hands-on feel for these methods through experiments with suitable data sets, using Jupyter notebooks. The third goal is to understand machine learning methods at a deeper level by delving into their mathematical underpinnings. This is crucial to being able to adapt and modify existing methods and to creatively combining them.

Course Outline
● Week 1: Introduction: nearest neighbor, and a host of prediction problems
● Week 2: Probability basics and generative modeling
● Week 3: Linear algebra basics, the multivariate Gaussian, and more generative modeling
● Week 4: Linear regression and logistic regression
● Week 5: Optimization
● Week 6: Support vector machines
● Week 7: Beyond linear prediction: kernel methods, decision trees, boosting, random forests
● Week 8: Clustering
● Week 9: Informative projections
● Week 10: Deep learning

Assignments and exams
● Weekly assignments (75% of grade): these have five components, of which four are graded.
○ Engagement (5%). This consists of simply checking the "mark as complete" button after viewing each video and associated materials.
○ Poll questions (0%).
○ Comprehensive quizzes (10%). These are simple multiple-choice questions based on the week's videos.
○ Problem sets (30%). These conceptual and mathematical problems are meant to cement understanding of the week's material.
○ Programming assignments (30%). These develop the ability to design and use machine learning algorithms.
● Final exam (25% of grade). This consists of conceptual and mathematical problems that cover the material from the entire course.

Grading
Grades will be assigned based on final scores, according to the following rubric:
85-100%: A
70-85%: B
50-70%: C
Less than 50%: F
